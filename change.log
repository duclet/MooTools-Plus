
Version 0.2
* Changed the default value for various options of LayerJS. Please check your code as this is not
	backwards compatible.
* Added ability to store HTML as an option for HtmlOptionsJS.
* Since now MooTools has delegation support for focus, blur, submit, and change, those
	functionalities has been removed from Element.Delegation.Plus. The delegateEvent method is still
	there though and will map the focusin and focusout event to their proper name in MooTools so the
	code is backwards compatible.
* Fixed bug with the continueChain method of ResponsesJS.
* Include pre-built files.
* Added a new script for auto complete.
* Upgraded MooTools Core to 1.3.1 and MooTools More to 1.3.1.1.
* Fixes JSDoc.
