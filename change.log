
Version 0.3
* There are a lot of non-backwards compatible changes here so check your code appropriately. But
	hey, until version 1.0 gets release, future release can also contain non-backwards compatible
	code.
* Bug fix with the redirect response for ResponsesJS.
* Added the method md5 and utf8_encode to String.Plus.
* Added AssetMangerJS, StoragesJS, PopupJS and TabJS.
* Looks to me like JSDoc changed their specs so guess what, I have updated all my docs to meet these
	new specs but I'm going to be using whatever is specified on the Goolge Closure page for it.
* Switch to using String.uniqueID for generating the ID in Element.Plus.
* AutoCompleteJS has changed how it handles the responses and is no longer backwards compatible.
	Though you'll only need to change the response handler to use the callback feature. Same with
	LayerJS as well. Reason for doing this is to provide more flexibility for future changes.
* Added Class.singleton which can be used to create singular instance classes.

2011/03/18:
Version 0.2
* Changed the default value for various options of LayerJS. Please check your code as this is not
	backwards compatible.
* Added ability to store HTML as an option for HtmlOptionsJS.
* Since now MooTools has delegation support for focus, blur, submit, and change, those
	functionalities has been removed from Element.Delegation.Plus. The delegateEvent method is still
	there though and will map the focusin and focusout event to their proper name in MooTools so the
	code is backwards compatible.
* Fixed bug with the continueChain method of ResponsesJS.
* Include pre-built files.
* Added a new script for auto complete.
* Upgraded MooTools Core to 1.3.1 and MooTools More to 1.3.1.1.
* Fixes JSDoc.
